## PREDICTING PROPERTY PRICES IN LAGOS STATE

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

There are multiple real estate classified websites where properties are listed for sale and rent purposes. These online listings have some inconsistencies in their pricing of same or similar properties and this often leads to in-transparency in the market.

Potential buyers, sometimes feel the prices of some listed properties are not justified and they have no alternative platform to confirm or verify. A justified property price model can bring in a lot of transparency and trust back to the property market, especially in Nigeria, where the average volume of a typical transaction is quite high.

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict property prices based on certain input features, like number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

### DATA

This project uses publicly available data of property prices in Nigeria from August 2018 to Aug 2020. The data was extracted via scraping the website of a leading Nigerian property firm - Nigeria Property Center (https://nigeriapropertycentre.com), who collates credible property listings.
